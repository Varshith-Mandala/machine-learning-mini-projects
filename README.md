# Machine Learning Mini Projects

This repository contains my machine learning implementations and experiments.

## Projects

### 01. Linear Regression
- Implemented using sklearn
- Evaluated using MSE

### 02. Logistic Regression
- Binary classification
- Evaluated using accuracy and confusion matrix

### 03. Decision Trees
- Compared depth variations
- Analyzed overfitting

## Goal

Building strong ML foundations before moving into Deep Learning and Transformers.
